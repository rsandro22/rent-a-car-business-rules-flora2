# Rent-a-Car Business Rules Knowledge Base (Flora-2)

Project for the *Declarative Programming* course.

This project implements a knowledge base of business rules for a rent-a-car system using the Flora-2 declarative programming language. The system models customers, vehicles, and rental requests, and applies logical rules to determine rental eligibility, rejection reasons, and required deposit amounts.

## Technologies

- Flora-2 (logic programming, knowledge bases)
- Emacs (execution environment)

## Project Structure

- `kb/rentacar.flr` – Flora-2 source code (knowledge base and rules)
- `kb/upiti.txt/` – contains example queries demonstrating how the business rules are evaluated
